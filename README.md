# SQL Project: Second Hand Car Dealer
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of second-hand cars for a fictional car dealership. Using SQL, I explored and answered various business-related questions that the client had about their car inventory, including trends in fuel types, year-wise availability, and overall car count. The queries provide valuable insights to assist the dealership in making informed decisions about their inventory, such as future availability, year-wise breakdowns, and the popularity of fuel types like petrol, diesel, and CNG.

## Dataset
#### The dataset car_dekho contains detailed information about second-hand cars including:

Car Make and Model

Year of Manufacture

Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)

Availability by Year
## Key Objectives
#### The primary objectives of this project are:

Total Car Count: Identify how many cars are available in the dataset.

Car Availability by Year: Understand the number of cars available each year, focusing on specific years like 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Fuel Type Breakdown: Examine the distribution of fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, CNG) across different years.

Year-wise Car Analysis: Determine in which years more than 100 cars were available and provide year-wise totals.

Detailed Yearly Breakdown: Extract complete car details between the years 2015 and 2023.

## Learning Outcomes


Writing SQL queries to analyze real-world datasets.

Using SQL aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING).

Data filtering using WHERE clauses and conditions for specific years and fuel types.

Performing year-wise data analysis to provide insights.

Understanding business requirements and translating them into database queries.
